### Description: 

In this hands-on session, you will delve into the world of Express, a popular and powerful Node.js framework. You will learn how to set up a basic server using Express and define a custom route "/api/main" that will provide a comprehensive understanding of what Express is and its role in web development.

### Requirements:
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine

### Additional Challenges (Optional):
- Implement error handling for the route
- Explore and incorporate middleware functions
- Experiment with different response formats such as JSON or HTML

### Hints:
1. Use the npm package manager to install Express if it's not already installed.
2. Utilize the `express` module to create an instance of the Express application.
3. Define a route using the `app.get()` method and the specified path "/api/main".
4. Use the `res.send()` method to send a descriptive response explaining the key features and benefits of using Express in web development.

### Additional Resources:
- Official Express.js documentation: https://expressjs.com/
- MDN Web Docs for JavaScript: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
- Node.js official documentation: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/

Explore the nuances of building a server with Express and gain a solid understanding of handling routes effectively. Have fun experimenting with the code and understanding the power of Express in simplifying complex server-side operations.
