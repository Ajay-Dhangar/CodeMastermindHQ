In this session, we will explore Postman, a powerful tool for testing and interacting with your Node.js APIs. Postman makes it easy to send requests, inspect responses, and test your API endpoints.

### What is Postman?

Postman is a popular API client that allows you to:

- **Send HTTP requests**: You can send GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP requests to your Node.js server.

- **Inspect responses**: Postman displays the response data in a user-friendly format, making it easy to understand the server's response.

- **Test API endpoints**: You can create tests to automate the validation of API responses.

- **Organize requests**: Postman lets you organize your requests into collections, making it easy to manage and share them.

### Installation

First, you need to install Postman. You can download it from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

### Sending a GET Request

Let's start with a simple example. We will send a GET request to a sample Node.js server running on your local machine.

**Live Code Example:**

```javascript
// Sample Node.js server
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Hello from Node.js' });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

1. Open Postman.
2. Create a new request.
3. Set the request type to GET.
4. Enter the URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/data`.
5. Click "Send."

You should receive a response with the message "Hello from Node.js."

### Testing an API Endpoint

Postman allows you to write tests to verify the responses from your API. Let's create a simple test:

**Live Code Example:**

```javascript
// Sample Node.js server response
const response = {
  message: 'Hello from Node.js',
};

// Postman test script
tests["Response status is 200"] = responseCode.code === 200;
tests["Response contains 'Hello from Node.js'"] = responseBody.has('Hello from Node.js');
```

1. In Postman, go to the "Tests" tab of your request.
2. Enter the test script as shown above.
3. Click "Send."

Postman will run the tests and display the results.

This is just the beginning of what you can do with Postman. You can explore more features like environment variables, collections, and automation to streamline your API development and testing process.
