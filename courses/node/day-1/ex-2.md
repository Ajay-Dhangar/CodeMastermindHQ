***Getting Started with Node.js: Installing Node.js and Setting Up Your Development Environment***

### Introduction

Before you embark on your Node.js journey, it's essential to set up your development environment correctly. This step will ensure that you have Node.js installed and ready for action. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of installing Node.js on your system. Let's get started!

### Installing Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on your local machine. To install Node.js, follow these simple steps:

#### Step 1: Download Node.js

1. Visit the official Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

2. You'll find two versions available for download: LTS (Long-Term Support) and Current. For beginners, it's recommended to download the LTS version, as it's more stable and widely used in production environments. Click on the "LTS" button to start the download.

#### Step 2: Installation

1. Once the download is complete, run the Node.js installer.

2. Follow the installation wizard's instructions. In most cases, you can proceed with the default settings.

3. During installation, Node.js will also install npm (Node Package Manager), which is an essential tool for managing packages and dependencies in your Node.js projects.

#### Step 3: Verification

After installation, it's crucial to verify that Node.js and npm are installed correctly. Here's how to do it:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt. You can find it in your operating system's applications.

2. To check if Node.js is installed, enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```shell
   node -v
   ```

   This command will display the version of Node.js installed on your system.

3. Next, check if npm is installed. Enter the following command and press Enter:

   ```shell
   npm -v
   ```

   This command will display the version of npm installed on your system.

#### Step 4: Code Editor

Before we proceed with writing Node.js code, it's a good idea to have a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) ready. Some popular options include Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or WebStorm. Choose one that you are comfortable with or explore different editors to find your preferred environment.

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js on your system and set up your development environment. In the next parts of this course, we'll dive deeper into Node.js concepts, and you'll even create your first Node.js program. Stay tuned, and happy coding!

This marks the completion of the first part of your Node.js course, focusing on installing Node.js and setting up the development environment. In the following days, you can expand on this foundation by delving into Node.js concepts and hands-on coding exercises.
