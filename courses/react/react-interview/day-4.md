### 29. What is lazy loading in react ?

<details>
   <summary>Answer:</summary>

**Lazy Loading in React:**

Lazy loading is a technique used in React to improve the performance of your web application by loading components only when they are needed. Instead of loading all the components when the page loads, lazy loading allows you to load specific components on-demand, as the user interacts with your app. This can help reduce the initial load time and improve the user experience.

**Example:**

Imagine you have a React application with multiple pages, and each page has its own set of components. Without lazy loading, when a user visits your application, all the components for all the pages would be loaded upfront, even if the user may not visit all of them.

With lazy loading, you can dynamically load components when they are actually needed. Let's say you have a "Settings" page in your app, and it has a complex configuration component. Using lazy loading, you can ensure that the configuration component is only loaded when the user navigates to the "Settings" page.

**Simple code example:**

```jsx
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

// Lazy load the components
const HomePage = lazy(() => import('./HomePage'));
const AboutPage = lazy(() => import('./AboutPage'));
const SettingsPage = lazy(() => import('./SettingsPage'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={HomePage} />
          <Route path="/about" component={AboutPage} />
          <Route path="/settings" component={SettingsPage} />
        </Switch>
      </Suspense>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `lazy` function is used to load the components only when they are actually needed. The `Suspense` component is used to show a fallback UI (in this case, "Loading...") while the lazy-loaded component is being fetched. This way, the "SettingsPage" component will only be loaded when the user navigates to the "/settings" route, reducing the initial load time.

Lazy loading is a powerful technique to optimize your React application's performance by loading resources only when required, improving user experience and reducing unnecessary initial data and code loading.

### 30. Difference between useEffect and useContext?

<details>
  <summary>Answer:</summary>

Difference between `useEffect` and `useContext` in React, using simple language and examples. 

| Aspect         | `useEffect`                                                                                                      | `useContext`                                                                                                     |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purpose        | Used for performing side effects (e.g., data fetching, DOM manipulation) after rendering.                    | Used for accessing context values (data) from a parent component without passing props through intermediaries. |
| Hook Type      | A hook that runs after every render.                                                                             | A hook that provides access to a specific context.                                                               |
| Usage          | ``` const Component = () => {   useEffect(() => {     // Side effect logic   }, [dependency]);   return (     // JSX   ); }; ``` | ``` const value = useContext(Context); ```                                                                   |
| Example        | ``` useEffect(() => {   document.title = "Updated Title"; }, []); ```                                      | ``` const user = useContext(UserContext); ```                                                                 |
| Dependency     | Optional array of dependencies to watch; if any dependency changes, the effect runs (empty array = once).  | Context to access, retrieved from a parent component's `Provider`.                                               |
| Use Cases      | Data fetching, DOM manipulation, subscriptions, etc.                                                            | Accessing global data like user authentication status, theme settings, etc.                                    |

**Example for `useEffect`:**
Let's say you have a component that needs to change the document title after rendering:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

const TitleUpdater = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = 'Updated Title';
  }, []);

  return <div>Component content</div>;
};
```

In this example, `useEffect` is used to update the document title after the component renders. The empty dependency array ensures that this effect runs only once, after the initial render.

**Example for `useContext`:**
Assume you have a context that holds the current user's information:

```jsx
import React, { useContext } from 'react';

const UserContext = React.createContext();

const UserProfile = () => {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return <div>{user.name}'s profile</div>;
};

// In a parent component, provide the user context
const App = () => {
  const user = { name: 'John' };

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <UserProfile />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `useContext` hook allows you to access the `user` object stored in the `UserContext` from the `UserProfile` component, without having to pass it down as a prop through every intermediate component.

:::tip
Remember, `useEffect` is mainly about handling side effects and running code after rendering, while `useContext` is about accessing global context data in a clean and efficient way.

### 31. Do you know about SEO ? Is it true that react js supports SEO support

<details>
  <summary>Answer:</summary>

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)**: SEO refers to the practice of optimizing your website so that search engines can easily understand its content and rank it higher in search results. The goal is to make your website more visible to people searching for relevant topics.

**ReactJS and SEO**:
ReactJS is a powerful JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive web applications. However, by default, React applications can face challenges when it comes to SEO because search engines might have difficulty interpreting the content rendered by React, which is often generated dynamically on the client side.

For example, if your React application relies heavily on client-side rendering and dynamic updates, search engines may have a hard time indexing your content properly. This can lead to lower search engine rankings and decreased visibility.

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and SEO**:
To address the SEO challenges, React offers a technique called Server-Side Rendering (SSR). SSR involves rendering your React components on the server side before sending the fully-rendered HTML to the client's browser. This way, search engines can easily read and index the content, just like they do with traditional websites.

Imagine you have a React application with a blog page. Without SSR, the blog posts might be loaded and displayed after the initial page load using JavaScript. This can be problematic for SEO. However, with SSR, the server generates the complete HTML for the blog posts, allowing search engines to index them accurately.

**Example**:
Let's say you have a React application that showcases various products. Without SSR, the product details might be loaded using JavaScript after the initial page load. This can lead to search engines not fully understanding the product information.

With SSR, when a user requests the product page, the server would render the product details directly into the HTML. So, when search engines crawl your site, they see all the product details right away. This boosts the chances of your products ranking higher in search results.

:::info
ReactJS itself might pose SEO challenges due to its dynamic rendering nature, but by implementing Server-Side Rendering (SSR), you can make your React applications more SEO-friendly. This means search engines can better understand and index your content, leading to improved visibility and rankings in search results.

### 32. What is the use of useCallback and useMemo?

<details>

<summary>Answer:</summary>
  
<code>useCallback</code>:

Imagine you're building a React application, and you have a component that renders a button. Whenever this button is clicked, it triggers a function. Now, you also have another component that renders something and uses this button-triggering function. Here's the catch: if you're not careful, every time the parent component renders, it could create a brand new instance of the function, even if it's the same code. This might lead to unnecessary re-renders of the child component.

`useCallback` comes to the rescue in this situation. It's a hook that helps you optimize your components by memoizing (caching) a function so that it doesn't get recreated every time the component renders, unless its dependencies change. This can help improve performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useCallback, useState } from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }, []); // No dependencies, so the function is cached and won't change

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
      <ChildComponent onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ onClick }) {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  // Render something that uses onClick
  return <div>Child component</div>;
}
```

**`useMemo`**:

Imagine you have a component that performs some complex calculations or data transformations inside its render function. Now, if these calculations don't change unless some specific data changes, it's inefficient to recompute them every time the component renders.

`useMemo` is another hook that helps optimize your components by memoizing the result of a function or computation, so it's only recomputed when the dependencies change.

**Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';
```

```jsx live

function ComplexCalculationComponent() {
  const [number, setNumber] = useState(5);

  const squaredNumber = useMemo(() => {
    console.log('Calculating squaredNumber');
    return number * number;
  }, [number]); // Recalculate only if 'number' changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Number: {number}</p>
      <p>Squared: {squaredNumber}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `squaredNumber` is computed using `useMemo`. It's only recalculated if the `number` state changes, otherwise, it uses the cached value.

:::info
Remember, both `useCallback` and `useMemo` are about optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary work. Use `useCallback` for caching functions and `useMemo` for caching values.

### 33. Do you know about redux?

<details>
    <summary>Answer:</summary>
  
Redux is a state management library often used with React to help manage and organize the application's global state. It provides a way to store and manage data that needs to be shared and accessed across different components in a predictable and consistent manner.

Imagine you're building a shopping app with React, and you need to keep track of the items in the user's cart throughout the app. Instead of passing the cart data through multiple layers of components, Redux allows you to centralize this data in a single store and access it from any component in your application.

**Simple breakdown of Redux concepts:**

1. **Store**: The store is the single source of truth for your application's state. It holds all the data that needs to be shared between components.

2. **Actions**: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that represent events or actions that can change the state. For instance, an action could be "add item to cart."

3. **Reducers**: Reducers are functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions. They take the current state and an action as input and return a new state. Reducers are pure functions, meaning they don't modify the state directly.

4. **Dispatch**: Dispatch is a function provided by Redux that allows you to send actions to the store. When an action is dispatched, it triggers the corresponding reducer, which then updates the state.

5. **Connect**: In React, the `connect` function from the `react-redux` library is used to connect components to the Redux store. This enables components to access the state and dispatch actions.

Here's a simple example of how you might use Redux in a React application:

1. **Setting up Redux**:

```bash
npm install redux react-redux
```

2. **Creating Actions and Reducers**:

```jsx
// actions.js
export const addToCart = (item) => ({
  type: 'ADD_TO_CART',
  payload: item,
});

// reducers.js
const initialState = {
  cart: [],
};

const cartReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'ADD_TO_CART':
      return {
        ...state,
        cart: [...state.cart, action.payload],
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default cartReducer;
```

3. **Creating the Store and Connecting to Components**:

```jsx title="store.js"
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import cartReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(cartReducer);

export default store;
```

4. **Using Redux in a Component**:

```jsx title="Product.js"
import React from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { addToCart } from './actions';

const Product = ({ product, addToCart }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>{product.name}</h3>
      <button onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  );
};

const mapDispatchToProps = {
  addToCart,
};

export default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(Product);
```

:::info
Remember, this is a simplified explanation and example. Redux can handle more complex scenarios, and there are additional concepts like middleware for asynchronous actions. In an interview, focus on explaining the core concepts (store, actions, reducers, dispatch, and connect) and how they work together to manage the application's state.
