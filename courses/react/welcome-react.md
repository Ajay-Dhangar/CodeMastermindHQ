> **React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.** React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.


Hello and welcome to the React course. My name is [Ajay Dhangar](https://twitter.com/CodesWithAjay) and I'm founder of [CMHQ](https://cmhq.tech). I will be your instructor for this course. I'm a software engineer and I have been working with React for the past 2 years. I have worked on multiple projects using React and I have also worked on JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and many other technologies.

I have created this course to help you learn React in a very simple and easy way. I will be covering all the important topics that you need to know to get started with React. I will also be sharing my knowledge and experience with you so that you can learn from my mistakes and avoid them.

I hope you will enjoy this course and learn a lot from it. If you have any questions or suggestions then feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CodesWithAjay).


## Now, let's get started with React
