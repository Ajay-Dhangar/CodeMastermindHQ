Git is an essential component of effective project management and version control. If you're new to Git, this guide will walk you through the initial setup for your React project.

## 1. Initializing Your Git Repository

If you haven't already initialized your project as a Git repository, open your terminal and run the following command in the root of your project:

```bash title="Terminal"
git init
```

Alternatively, you can use tools like VSCode to initialize your project as a Git repository.

## 2. Creating .gitignore

To ensure that certain files and directories are not tracked by Git, create a file named `.gitignore` at the root of your project and add the following content:

```gitignore title=".gitignore"
# Ignore node_modules directory
node_modules

# Ignore distribution files
dist/

# Ignore environment variable files
.env

# Ignore system-specific files
.DS_Store

# Ignore test coverage reports
coverage/

# Ignore VSCode configuration files
.vscode/
```

This `.gitignore` file helps prevent unnecessary files and directories from being added to your Git repository.

## 3. Committing Changes

After creating the `.gitignore` file, commit the changes to your Git repository. Run the following commands:

```bash title="Terminal"
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Git setup and .gitignore"
```

This commits the current state of your project, including the `.gitignore` file.
