### Origins:

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, has been the backbone of the World Wide Web since its inception. It was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, while he was working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) in the late 1980s. Berners-Lee envisioned HTML as a simple markup language for creating and sharing documents over the internet.

### HTML 1.0:

The first version of HTML, known as HTML 1.0, was released in 1991. It provided basic formatting tags for structuring text, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists. HTML 1.0 laid the foundation for the web by introducing the concept of hyperlinks, which allowed users to navigate between documents.

**Example:**

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN">
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to the World Wide Web!</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### HTML 2.0:

HTML 2.0, released in 1995, introduced new features such as tables for organizing data and forms for collecting user input. This version also standardized the use of attributes within HTML tags, allowing developers to add additional information to elements.

**Example:**

```html title="index.html"
<TABLE BORDER="1">
  <TR>
    <TD>Row 1, Column 1</TD>
    <TD>Row 1, Column 2</TD>
  </TR>
  <TR>
    <TD>Row 2, Column 1</TD>
    <TD>Row 2, Column 2</TD>
  </TR>
</TABLE>
```

### HTML 3.2:

HTML 3.2, released in 1997, marked a significant milestone in the evolution of HTML. It introduced support for more advanced features, including tables with advanced formatting options, image maps for creating clickable images, and the `<iframe>` element for embedding content from other sources.

**Example:**

```html title="index.html"
<IFRAME SRC="https://www.example.com"></IFRAME>
<H2>This is a <SUP>superscript</SUP>.</H2>
```

### HTML 4.01:

HTML 4.01, released in 1999, further expanded the capabilities of HTML with the introduction of style sheets for controlling the presentation of web pages. It also introduced new structural elements such as `<div>` and `<span>`, paving the way for more flexible and semantically meaningful markup.

**Example:**

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN">
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML 4.01 Example</title>  
</head>
<body>
  <div>
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to HTML 4.01</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Main Content</h2>
      <p>This is the main content of the webpage.</p>
      <p><span style="color: red;">This is a span element with inline styling.</span></p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

### XHTML:

In the early 2000s, the XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) specification emerged as an evolution of HTML, aiming to bring XML's strict syntax to HTML. XHTML combined the flexibility of HTML with the well-formedness requirements of XML, making it easier to create interoperable web content.

**Example:**

```xhtml title="index.xhtml"
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"
  "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
<head>
  <title>XHTML Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

### HTML5:

HTML5, released in 2014, represented a major leap forward in the evolution of HTML. It introduced a wide range of new features and APIs for creating rich, interactive web applications, including native support for audio and video playback, canvas for drawing graphics dynamically, and geolocation for accessing the user's location.

**Example:**

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>HTML5 Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <article>
      <h2>Article Title</h2>
      <p>This is the content of the article.</p>
    </article>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
```

### Current State:

HTML continues to evolve with ongoing developments and refinements. The latest version, HTML Living Standard, is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). It continues to push the boundaries of what is possible on the web, shaping the future of digital experiences for years to come.
