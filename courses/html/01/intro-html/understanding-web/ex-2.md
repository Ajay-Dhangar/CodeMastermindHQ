### Why is HTML Important?

2. **Accessibility**: HTML also makes web pages accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. By using the right HTML tags, we can make sure everyone can understand and use our websites.

3. **Compatibility**: HTML works on all web browsers, like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. So, no matter what browser people use, they can still view and interact with our web pages.

4. **Works with Other Technologies**: HTML works together with CSS and JavaScript. CSS makes our web pages look pretty, while JavaScript adds fun stuff like animations and interactive features.
