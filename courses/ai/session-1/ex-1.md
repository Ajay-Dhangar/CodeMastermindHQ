### Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science dedicated to creating computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. It involves the development of intelligent agents that can perceive their environment and make decisions to maximise the chances of successfully achieving their goals.

### AI problems

AI problems can be broadly categorised into the following:

**1. Search Problems:**
- Search problems involve finding a sequence of actions or states that lead from an initial state to a goal state. This is often represented as a state space.
- Algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* searches are used to solve search problems.
   
**2. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning Problems:**
- These problems focus on how knowledge can be represented in a way that allows AI systems to reason and make decisions.
- Logic programming, propositional logic, and first-order predicate logic are used for representation and reasoning.
   
**3. Planning Problems:**
- In planning problems, AI systems need to decide on a sequence of actions to achieve a particular goal.
- Goal stack planning, hierarchical planning, and reactive systems are methods for solving planning problems.

**4. Uncertainty Problems:**
- AI often deals with uncertain information. Problems here involve reasoning about situations with incomplete or uncertain data.
- Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic, and certainty factors are used for reasoning under uncertainty.

**5. Natural Language Processing Problems:**
- These problems involve understanding and generating human language. They encompass tasks like language translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots.
- Syntactic and semantic analysis are crucial in solving NLP problems.

**6. Expert Systems Problems:**
- Expert systems aim to mimic the decision-making abilities of a human expert in a specific domain.
- Knowledge acquisition, validation, and building rule-based systems are common challenges.

**7. Machine Learning Problems:**
- Machine learning is a key subset of AI, dealing with problems like classification, regression, clustering, and reinforcement learning.
- It includes algorithms like decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines.

**8. Perception Problems:**
- These problems involve making sense of sensory data, such as image recognition, speech recognition, and object detection.
- Techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in solving perception problems.

**9. Robotics Problems:**
- AI in robotics deals with problems related to robot control, path planning, and manipulation tasks.
Solutions involve algorithms for navigation and manipulation.

**10. Game Playing Problems:**
- AI is applied in playing complex games like chess, Go, and video games.
- Minimax search, alpha-beta pruning, and neural networks are used in game-playing AI.
